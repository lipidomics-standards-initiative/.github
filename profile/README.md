Welcome to the GitHub repository of code developments and outputs of the [International Lipidomics Society's](https://lipidomicssociety.org/) interest group on [Lipidomics Standardization (Lipidomics Standards Initiative)](https://lipidomicstandards.org).

## mzTab-M for Lipidomics (mzTab-L) (under development)

mzTab-L is a collection of best-practices and semantic validation rules for reporting of lipidomics experiments using mass spectrometry, based on the HUPO-PSI MS format [mzTab-M](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzTab) for Metabolomics.
